# JAVA lexicon program
lexicon program provides searching for a certain word's neighbours that are differing in only one letter, as well as matching a string of pattern with words stored in a dataset.

The data structure used in this project is separate chaining HashTables containing AVL-Trees to minimize searching time when a large set of words is used.
